# CadreAI Email Classifier - Full Development Documentation

## Project Summary

This project implements a Large Language Model (LLM) system to classify incoming emails into structured categories and generate appropriate, reasoned replies automatically.

The system was developed as part of the CadreAI technical assignment.

---

## Development Process

### Initial Setup

- Cloned the provided GitHub repository: `llm-email-classifier-test`
- Structured the project with a focus on modularity and clarity
- Set up a `conda` environment named `cadre-ai` using Python 3.10
- Installed core dependencies:
  - `pandas`
  - `openai`
  - `python-dotenv`

### Environment Issues Encountered

- Initial installs caused **numpy/pandas binary mismatch errors**.
- Observed the error:  
  `ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility`
- Root cause: Mixing pip and conda packages without managing binary dependencies properly.

#### Solution

- Completely **removed and reinstalled Anaconda** to ensure a clean environment.
- Rebuilt environment strictly:
  - Created a **new `cadre-ai` environment** cleanly.
  - Installed pinned package versions to ensure stability.
- Deleted the unnecessary `src/` folder to align with the expected project structure.

## System Architecture

| Component | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `EmailProcessor` | Classifies emails and generates responses with Chain of Thought prompting |
| `EmailAutomationSystem` | Full pipeline for processing, handling, and logging email interactions |
| Mock functions | Simulate sending email responses, creating support tickets, logging feedback |
| `.env` | Stores the OpenAI API key securely (not pushed to GitHub) |

## Key Changes and Enhancements

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

#### 1. Classification

- **Chain of Thought prompting** added to guide the model:
  - Read the email
  - Think step-by-step about the issue
  - Map the issue carefully to one of the predefined categories:
    - `complaint`
    - `inquiry`
    - `feedback`
    - `support_request`
    - `other`

#### 2. Response Generation

- Introduced a **structured, multi-step reasoning prompt** before drafting the final response:
  - Step 1: Summarize the issue
  - Step 2: Determine tone (angry, neutral, happy, confused)
  - Step 3: Assess urgency (low, medium, high)
  - Step 4: Generate a professional response incorporating prior steps

- Example output format:
  ```
  Reasoning:
  1. Issue: Customer received a broken product.
  2. Tone: Angry
  3. Urgency: High

  Drafted Response:
  We are truly sorry to hear about the damaged product...
  ```

---

## Implementation Highlights

- **Chain-of-thought prompts** make outputs more reliable and consistent.
- **Categorization validation** checks that results belong to allowed categories.
- **Robust error handling** ensures that failures (e.g., API issues) are logged cleanly.
- **Separation of concerns**:
  - One method for classification
  - One method for response generation
  - One method for email pipeline processing
- **Extensible handlers** allow easy addition of future categories (e.g., "sales leads").

## Final Run

The final system can be executed with:

```bash
python email_classifier_template.py
```

The console shows a detailed **Processing Summary** table that tracks:
- Email ID
- Success status
- Final classification
- Whether a response was sent

Example:

| Email ID | Success | Classification | Response Sent |
|:--------|:--------|:----------------|:-------------|
| 001 | True | complaint | Yes |
| 002 | True | inquiry | Yes |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

---

## Additional Notes

- **OpenAI API Key** must have the correct scopes (model access) to function.
- No external services like email servers or ticketing systems are integrated â€” mock logging is used instead.
- The project structure now matches exactly what CadreAI provided, with thoughtful upgrades where appropriate.
